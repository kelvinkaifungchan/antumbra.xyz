          text: "As we enter a hyper-consumerist era governed by “big data” and “surveillance capitalism”, data has become an all-powerful technocratic instrument in the negotiation of many socio-political sectors, including the negotiations within Climate Politics. According to the market intelligence agency IDC, global data reached up to an astonishing data cap of 18 zettabytes in 2018 with no signs of slowing down whatsoever. In the UK alone, there are over 1500 sites, which monitor air quality - these monitoring networks, in turn, continuously gather and process data in real-time. Although these networks continuously produce a wide range of both descriptive and exceedance statistics, not all data produced is easily accessible for the public realm, and neither does it remain unchallenged by other information sources. Both governments and high-technology corporations now compete to gather and analyze data, at the expense of their respective citizens’ and consumers’ health and privacy. It has become an ultimate quest to gather, process, and to manipulate as much data as one can for financial profit - to meet certain environmental quotas, such as UK Air Quality Objectives, EU Limit and Target Values, and Critical Loads . Data abstraction and spreading misinformation have become powerful tools for such agencies, and to objectively interpret available datasets has become an increasingly challenging task for the general populace."

          text: "Many new readers may be unfamiliar with this open hostility, as it has been cleverly masked by numerous agencies involved in this conflict. A clear example of this is the UK’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 to meet the suggested quotas by the National Air Quality Standards. These discussions, however, cleverly avoids the discussions of the ever-increasing offshoring of CO2 emissions. This includes discussions of importing carbon-intensive goods and electricity from overseas - during the “coal free” fortnight in 2019, no domestic coal was used to power the UK grid, however, the UK imported an estimated 40.5 GWH of Dutch coal-generated electricity. The data and the information involved in this event was cleverly avoided by the apparatus of ubiquity and the promises of a “greener tomorrow”. Energy and Infrastructure analyst Tony Lodge further describes  this in his lecture “The Great Carbon Swindle” in regards to how the UK is able to cleverly mask the emissions involved in supply chains and how it avoids carbon levies through layers of convoluted bureaucracy. This has become much more imminent in recent years, as the UK now imports six times more electricity than it exports, which is currently exempt from carbon levies. This, fundamentally, confuses the general populace, who cannot know the actual source of electricity that they are using. In short, this has become an open hostility to acquire the “real picture” of UK sustainability."

          text: 'The same principle applies to the UK’s construction and agricultural sectors. Greenhouse gas emissions from imported goods and raw materials, e.g. steel, coal, brick, etc. are currently exempt in UK statistics, thus allowing the UK to continue using carbon-intensive energy and goods, while appearing to meet both domestic and EU emission targets. A clear example of this is the UK promise of shutting down domestic coal pits - in truth, millions of tonnes of coal were imported overseas over the last few years for industrial use, thereby hiding the real picture of UK greenhouse gas emissions. Additional emissions costs incurred by transportation of these goods were also exempt in these statistics, thus providing a dishonest image of UK gas emissions. This data warfare has ultimately led to an intense discrimination against domestic UK companies (which are subject to climate levies), compared to their overseas competitors. The manipulation and abstraction of data have become powerful tools to direct domestic climate change policies, which may, in fact, be detrimental to the UK in the long run.'

Although most Londoners will agree that monitoring air pollutants is key to monitoring climate change in cities, very few are able to answer the question “Where does this data go?” Some say the government, and others say Google, or some other high-technology corporation. Quick Google-searches lead to websites, such as the London Air Quality Network, which provides abstractified air pollutant maps, either in “real-time” or on an annual basis. However, on closer inspection, a new question arises: “Why is the data abstractified?” Abstract data maps imply that detailed data is unavailable for the public realm, and can only be requested either via filling out forms or via purchase. Here, we see that “free goods” have become questionable for consumption; it renders requirements for basic human needs as commodities, while leaving “free goods” untouched as non-commodities.'

Processed data sets and abstract data maps of carbon dioxide are now widely accessible through the London Datastore and the UK NAEI (National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory) at no to little cost whatsoever, however, this data is limited. Other datasets provided by government networks are subject to OGL (Open Government License), and under the constraints of OGL, numerous agencies are able to combine their data with government-licensed datasets to exploit this data both commercially and non-commercially. They are able to adapt, manipulate, and publish this data in conjunction with their own product and/or application; thus,  it becomes somewhat easy to spread misinformation under the guise of “government-licensed datasets.” In addition, real-time measurements of CO2 levels in the UK are almost always processed and abstractified, provided in either monthly or yearly intervals.

This includes background pollution maps at 1 x 1 km resolution, which are modeled under Defra’s MAAQ (Modeling of Ambient Air Quality) contract to fulfill UK’s CO2 reporting obligations to the EU. Although this data is publicly available for research applications (e.g. university studies and public health surveys), there are key grid squares, which are currently labeled as “missing”. To complement this missing data, UK’s Defra suggests to utilize alternative Local Authority-specific maps, which are based on the same CO2 monitoring and modeling tools. This convoluted bureaucracy of recording and managing data maps has gradually become a key hurdle in understanding the “real picture” of UK sustainability. However, the general populace can do very little, but to accept the provided abstracted data. The question of missing data, in turn, raises additional questions - why is the data missing to begin with?'

It is conducted through well-thought out operational practices, where either limited raw data or abstracted datasets are presented as full datasets to the general populace. This seemingly transparent attitude taken by various government and environmental agencies cannot be anything further than the truth. The datafication of “free goods” ultimately leads to stores of privatized raw data and unaltered knowledge, only accessible by a few. It illustrates that the apparatus of ubiquity is, in fact, a method to overcome the hurdles involved in the general populace’s fundamental human rights to non-commodities. This is further accomplished by the movement of data, as illustrated by NAEI’s FAQ section, under the question “Are there UK emission maps for previous years?”. According to the NAEI, “UK emission maps are only available for the latest inventory year [...] [and they] do not generate a time series of emissions maps for trend analysis.” Where then does the data for previous years go? Recalcitrant citizens will only number in a few; agencies will always argue that the general populace will always have access to both raw (albeit limited) and abstracted data, which they argue, is “more than enough”. No moral or legal constraints will stand in the way for such agencies, as long as they are ubiquitous enough to satisfy the general populace.'

It offers a new template for future climate change policies, where the “real picture” is forfeit for others’ profit. It has become much more difficult to discern the truth in the fog of utopian rhetoric conjured by numerous profit-driven agencies. In short, this becomes a question of the ownership of environmental “free goods” data? Who has access to it? Who knows? Who decides who knows? Failure to answer these questions will inevitably lead to more hidden pollution, insecure UK power supplies and, ultimately, more global greenhouse gas emissions.'

I’m paraphrasing. And there are in fact beautiful, pneumatic works by artists who were based in Martinique, Cairo, Tokyo, Puerto Rico and Mexico, as well as Europe. The geographical and cultural breadth of the exhibition invites visitors to join some conceptual dots in their heads, in order to appreciate the movement’s poignant scope and versatility. After the dot-joining, we see that core Surrealist principles and manifestoes are moulded by environmental factors, political landscapes and societal boundaries in each artist’s world, rather than by a projection of European life. This is special and results in a series of spaces that give raw, incisive accounts of the artists’ lives.'

The 1947 piece is an anti-imperialist manifesto imploring that France ends its post-war occupation of Vietnam.

Intentional abandonment of roads, settlements and cultivated land could allow for the strategic distribution of resources as the maintenance of overextended infrastructure systems in the face of climate change become more acute.\n\nIn territories where sedentary settlement can no longer be taken for granted, the flow of water will become a new reference point for political organization and human settlement.

In all of these examples, aesthetics refers to pleasurable experiences mediated by our senses. The term can also include concepts such as style and aesthetic judgments that assess the value of an artwork, although the nature of the relationship between aesthetics and art has become an object of debate in contemporary times. We also make everyday aesthetic decisions when creating graphs, capturing and editing photos and videos, drawing images, and designing spaces and buildings. Aesthetics covers both natural and human-made objects and experiences.\n\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, computation, data analysis, machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) — an all-encompassing and catchy label with a shifting definition — have all gradually entered the aesthetic realm. For example, music streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora automatically recommend music we may like. Instagram’s Explore tab automatically curates photos and videos in a way that is personalized for each user. Automatic one-button photo improvement is a standard feature in all mobile and desktop apps for editing photos. Large online fashion retailers offer automatic suggestions for additional clothing items, and so on.\n\nThese systems rely on increasingly sophisticated methods to predict what people might like. Deep neural networks, for example, learn principles of aesthetic quality by directly observing people’s aesthetic choices. Earlier predictions of image quality ratings were based on classical compositional rules (such as the rule of thirds, aspect ratio, saturation, and so on) as well as on the programmers’ intuition of aesthetic value, which derived from their observation of the most liked photographs. Later, neural networks were progressively used to assign semantic labels (“meanings”) and to automatically extract aesthetically relevant features through the analysis of large databases of liked images."

In other words, this complex field becomes the ultimate testing ground for AI’s possibilities and limitations.\n\nStill, a prevailing opinion holds that developments like those mentioned above just *mimic* existing styles and are not creative at all. In those instances, computers receive pre-existing examples and generate variants conforming to their patterns, while trying to introduce some level of variation. Sometimes they are *uncannily* similar to genuine artworks, but this can also mean that they seem a bit off to a trained eye, lacking the final touches that would make them convincingly human. These algorithms do not generate styles of music or painting that are entirely new, instead they are instances of what we might call *computational mannerism.*\n\nHowever, it could be just a matter of time until even the experts are deceived and an AI produces artworks that are judged as aesthetically superior to their human variants. One should bear in mind that the examples mentioned above involve artwork sets with a good amount of repetition and low variability: qualities that enable neural networks to extract general features and generate new examples easily. In other words, it seems particularly straightforward to produce traditional or classical artworks as they tend to display a clear, recognizable style and follow the specific patterns of an artist, school, or tradition. Machine learning systems are ideally suited to analyse numerous occurrences of an object type with slight variations and extract the relevant features and patterns.'

We have biologically limited visual acuity, but microscopes and telescopes allowed us to amplify the realm of the visible. Similarly, our cognitive skills such as calculation and memory have upper limits, but calculators and computers augmented those skills. Following this line of argumentation, one could suggest that aesthetic capacity has human limits as well, that there could be a point at which peak creativity, or peak aesthetic sensibility, is reached. Limits would be determined by both the individual, who has their own supply of sensitivity, creativity, and skills, and by the culture as a whole, which delimits what is possible within a specific artistic medium.\n\nArtificial aesthetics can be described as an augmentation of our aesthetic skills, deepening both our creative processes and our understanding and sensibility of cultural artefacts. Advanced systems would then be a further evolution of devices that are already used in creative disciplines, such as graphic programs, computer-aided design technology, music software, and so on (see later chapters on creativity, media theory, and digital culture). If in a traditional sense media are extensions of human senses, then AI is a further extension of human capabilities in mediating between us and the world.'

          text: 'The original definition of aesthetics as a philosophical discipline was coined in 1750 by German philosopher Alexander Baumgarten and referred to the ancient Greek *aesthesis*, which means sensation or perception. Kant later redefined the term in his *Critics of Judgment* (1790) as the domain of subjective judgments of taste. This meant that aesthetics treated perception as a more complex notion than just sensory experience (investigated today by the psychology of perception), as it also sought to address our affective and cognitive responses to perception. Machines learn to recognize increasingly complex patterns in data that humans are not able to detect. All this raises the following question: to what extent are machine perception and pattern recognition mechanisms relevant for “aesthetic perception,” and what are the typically human aspects of aesthetic sensibility that still need to be tackled by artificial systems?\n\n**Patterns of explanation, or what do we do when we talk about aesthetics**\n\nComputational analysis may enable us to extract patterns and formal structures, but it does not provide an understanding of how such patterns affect human perception, emotion, and cognition. Patterns considered in isolation from human meaning are ultimately empty. Art historian Michael Baxandall (in his 1985 book *Patterns of Intention*) has persuasively described the essence of the critical language that we use when talking about any artwork or cultural product. For Baxandall, any discourse that we create is neither a merely factual description of features, nor a subjective report of a persons reactions, but consists in highlighting the *relationship* between the object and human responses (the meaning they give and the aesthetic reaction they manifest. This relationship is further mediated by an understanding of the object’s symbolic and cultural meanings. A critic, so to speak, tells the reader what kind of reaction is expected (or would have been expected for people in the past) in front of a specific object. Expressed in the terms of the map from the previous section, this would mean drawing a connection between the description of the object and the description of the corresponding subjective reactions.'

          text: 'Following Baxandall, cultural and critical explanations in art are not mere descriptions or classifications: they are “primarily a representation of our thoughts about it” (*Patterns of intention*, p. 10). What we describe is a “partially interpretative description”: “one does not describe pictures, but our thoughts of having seen pictures” or at least hypotheses on those thoughts. The efficacy of a critic’s argumentation lies in his or her ability to compellingly persuade the reader that the artefact elicits the kind of reactions and thoughts that the critic is claiming to make explicit. Moreover, the critic’s use of words and concepts, while sharpening the perception of an object, at the same time deepens the meaning of the concept itself: “concepts and object reciprocally sharpen each other” (*Patterns of intention*, p 34). For example, if we describe *The Scream* by Edvard Munch (1893) as inspiring a sense of dread, then the very concept of *dread* as an aesthetic notion will be made richer by using Munch’s famous painting as a case in point.\n\nHowever, if the generated content is expected to have aesthetic value, the generative networks must take into account not only the formal dimension (*how* artefacts are made), but also their corresponding subjective interpretation and reaction, including people’s aesthetic preferences. Otherwise, we would be able to generate infinite variations of patterns, but not have a clue on how they relate to our appreciation. If description of patterns without meaning is empty, as we said, generation of patterns without human interpretation is blind.'

This result also depends on humans following their own aesthetic sensibility: for example, a music expert had to evaluate and filter the different generations of Schubert's *Unfinished Symphony*. Only algorithmic analysis of subjective responses (“Studying subjects”) would allow a progressive automation of this evaluative step.\n\nMoreover, “Studying subjects” would involve both individual and collective reactions. The latter involves analyzing historically sedimented responses towards cultural objects. Ideally, an AI capable of creating meaningful art and design would take into account the history of what exists, not only to extrapolate patterns from the artefacts, but also to interpret their collective reception, that is, how people over time have reacted to these artefacts. Thus, **using an AI to generate new cultural artefacts (and assist human creators) will require using an AI for cultural analysis.** This would necessitate bringing artificial aesthetics into contact with the various fields that deal with this issue: philosophical aesthetics, art history, psychology of art, anthropology and sociology of culture, and so on. Granted, new technical developments can generate entirely new kinds of artefacts that need not resemble the cultural production of the past. However, if we want to better grasp how these artefacts could affect people, an understanding of how we typically react and give meaning to aesthetic objects could save us from wandering in the dark. The near future may hold entirely new aesthetic artefacts, but it is unlikely to hold an entirely new human nature."

We are both constantly photographing and being photographed, with professional-level devices shrunk to a pocket size and seemingly infinite ‘cloud’ storage available at our constant disposal. The posing of the question, ‘Does photography have a future?’, may therefore seem premature or plainly absurd, given the extreme popularity of the photographic medium. However, this question is intended as a provocation, aimed at challenging our common-sense perception of the current state of things, including the frequently posited equivalence between popularity and longevity. Its theoretical impetus comes from the work of Vilém Flusser – not just his well-known texts on photography but also his important book Does Writing Have a Future?. (Flusser answers his own question in the negative, an argument that offers not so much a prophecy about our imminent illiteracy but rather a complex analysis of the inherent co-constitution of humans by and with our multiple media, with all its consequences.) Given that photography is increasingly decoupled from human agency and human vision – as evidenced in practices such as satellite imaging, drone media, CCTV and face recognition, and that the distinction between mechanical image capture and image creation is increasingly blurred (in, e.g., photogrammetry, computational photog- raphy or CGI), the question explored in this chapter concerns both the future of light-induced, mechanically produced images conventionally understood as photographs and the future of us humans as producers of and as beings produced by such images."

Artist Trevor Paglen, who uses images from satellites, surveillance cameras and machine vision databases, goes so far as to argue that ‘Something dramatic has happened to the world of images: they have become detached from human eyes. Our machines have learnt to see without us’. In response to the question posed in one of his online contributions written for Photomuseum Winterthur, ‘Is Photography Over?’, Paglen even claims that ‘“photography,'' as it has been traditionally understood in theory and practice, has undergone a transition – it has become something else, something that’s difficult to make sense of within the existing analytic framework’.\n\n**Media Existentialism: Vilém Flusser Redux**"

To work towards answering these questions about photography’s future it is worth recognising, as indicated at the beginning of this chapter, that the very posing of the question about photography’s future articulates a number of concerns regarding not just the status of a specific industry or media practice but rather some larger, or even planetary-level, concerns about our human positioning in the world and our relationship with technology, at a time when our very existence is being increasingly challenged by attempts to envisage what comes next. This may seem like too big a leap, but I want to make a proposition that, by asking, with Paglen and others, whether photography (as we know it) is over, whether it has any future, we are actually using this specific cultural-technical practice to ponder whether everything else we know – including us humans as a species with particular cultural exigencies and technical affordances – will soon be over too. We are therefore using photography, although not always in a fully conscious way, as a conduit for asking a bigger question about our own situation in the world. It is in this sense that photography functions as an example of what Amanda Lagerkvist has described as ‘existential media’, i.e., media that are capable of accounting for ‘the thrownness of the digital human condition’. This perspective analyses media life as an existential terrain which is irreducible ‘to the social, the cultural, the economic, or the political’, even if it remains intertwined with all those domains. With this existential mode of enquiry, we are also faced with another question: ‘What comes after the human?’. Building on the legacy of ghost and spirit photography, a practice combining imagination and charlatanerie to make up for personal losses before the Great War, and collective loss in its aftermath, digital and post-digital image making can be mobilised to help us imagine, visualise and frame the future – and to image and imagine our- selves as part of that future."

Photography and other forms of mechanical images such as films and TV have certainly played a role in aiding us with envisaging our demise. Yet, its repre- sentational role aside, it is worth delving deeper into photographic practice, with its apparatuses and networks, to trace the constitutive role of mechanical image making in enacting a certain vision of the future – or even enacting a certain future, full stop. One thinker who can help us with developing such an existential analytic framework for understanding the world today – which for him is equivalent with the world of images – is the Czech-born writer and philosopher Vilém Flusser (1920–1991). A nomad at heart if not always by choice, with the ruinous legacy of the Holocaust and antisemitism casting a dark shadow over both his family history and his work, Flusser wrote in multiple languages, disciplines, registers and styles, across several continents, decades and intellectual currents. His work on photography and other media emerged largely in the early 1980s. This was a time when media production had already been mechanised in the Benjaminian sense, with photographs’ and films’ reproducibility in the early twentieth century leading to the loss of cultural artefacts’ uniqueness as singular objects endowed with a special aura and value, and also to their democratisation and their becoming-media – but it had not yet entered the era of mass digitisation. Yet Flusser’s analyses are uncannily prescient in grasping the consequences of the automation of image production and reception, one that we see today not just in photography, video and other forms of communication such as journalism and literature, but also in politics."

He differentiates them from ‘traditional images’ such as cave or oil paintings, which for him have a different relation to reality; the former are mimetic, the latter function as visualisations, i.e., models. ‘Traditional images’ are two-dimensional surfaces, while technical images are ‘without dimension’. Mark Poster is right to raise a suspicion about the rigidity or even accuracy of this distinction, one that is premised on the excessive ontologisation of the earlier forms of visual expression as ritualistic and magic-driven, at the expense of appreciating their own specific technicity. It would therefore have been more productive perhaps to extend the concept of ‘technical images’ to, say, cave paintings – which for Flusser serve as quintessential images from pre-technological magic time – in order to trace their communicative value and their formative role in producing human memory and human consciousness. Yet this reservation does not diminish the significance of Flusser’s argument, which is premised on noticing the technicity of (at least some) images in the first place, i.e., noticing their informational value."

          text: "Photographs, addressed most explicitly in Flusser’s book Towards a Philosophy of Photography, are one class of such technical images, alongside film, television, video and other hybrid forms. Taking analogue photographs and other mechanically reproduced images as his starting point, we must note that Flusser is not really looking at them – but rather far beyond them, into the future of both images and humanity. This future is looking rather bleak; Flusser goes so far as to describe it as an ultimate catastrophe, because ‘images themselves are apocalyptic’. We will come back to this provocative idea later on. For now, let us ask whether, by not really looking at photographs, Flusser is not repeating the error of many other theorists who have thought about media without actually using them in any meaningful way, thus reducing the operational technicity of those media and the outcomes of those operations to the banality of a mere example – or, worse, to a figment of their imagination. He would be in good company here; as Flusser’s translator Nancy Roth observes, ‘Virtually all of the voices that have substantially shaped contemporary photographic “orthodoxy”, not only the historians, but critics, including Benjamin ... Barthes ... Sontag ... wrote as receivers and judges of photographs, from the position Barthes designated the Spectator’. Yet Roth jumps at Flusser’s defence by making an important differentiation: ‘As Barthes is looking at photographs, Flusser is looking at photographing ... By framing his topic as a gesture, a particular kind of movement between states of consciousness and states of affairs, Flusser was able, in a way no other writer on photography has been, to take the photographer’s part’. There is therefore a rationale for Flusser’s avoidance of looking not just at photographs but also at the photographed objects. Instead of looking at them, Flusser is looking through the photographic flow of images, and towards a future that, to cite Poster, entails ‘a more complex possibility for multiple assemblages of the human and the machine, not as prostheses for the human but as mixtures of human-machine in which the outcome of specific forms of the relation are not prefigured in the initial conceptualization of the relation’. Flusser himself argues that interest in technical images on the part of ‘future men and women’ will have an ‘existential’ value, as it will allow them to dream up new visions of the world, and of their place in it. Images for him thus serve as devices, offering an insight into the modern world in which we are all being constituted by the technical apparatus, becoming its functionaries."

It’s just that these images are so predictable, so banal and hence so redundant in the informational sense that Flusser moves beyond their superficial value and looks at them as objects in a broader communicative sense. We could perhaps go so far as to say that Flusser perceives images the way computers (and specifically, machine vision systems) do: breaking an image into a cluster of pixels to be analysed for similarity and difference with other clusters in the database, and then matching it against the available categories and labels. Yet Flusser’s theory allows us to concede that this machinic way of looking is not just a feature of machines, or an eccentric philosopher looking, literally, against the grain. Using his theory, we can perhaps surmise that most humans now look at most images automatically, scanning them for similarity and difference, engaging in quick categorisation (on a binary level: like/not like; or a semantic one, via comments and hashtags), and going along with the media flow."

But he also reveals a strong commitment to writing as a form of zig- zagging through ideas, concepts and modes of expression to produce what could be described as thinking in action. This is undertaken in spite of Flusser’s broader prophecy about the waning of writing as a mode of expression for the contemporary human, offering instead that we are moving towards a post-writing form of culture, driven by what he calls technical images. Indeed, for Flusser writing as the dominant mode of developing and transmitting a linear argument has no future; it has already been replaced, to a large extent, by communication via technical images. Given that Flusser was writing in the early 1980s, before digital technology radically altered our speed and form of communication, before blogging gave way to image sharing via Instagram and Snapchat and before reading was largely replaced by scrolling and touching, his theory of the end of print is indeed nothing short of prophetic. In their by now also ‘classic’ 2008 essay ‘A Life More Photographic: Mapping the Networked Image’, which analyses the state of photography in the age of the phone camera, digital snapshot and broadband, Daniel Rubinstein and Katrina Sluis look at a research project analysing the practice of users of the photo sharing platform Flickr, many of whom said they had given up blogging because it was ‘too much work’ and now favoured photography as a way of sharing their experiences. Rubinstein and Sluis argue that ‘The practices of moblogging (blogging with a mobile phone) and photoblogging (blogging with photographs rather then text) further exploit the way in which mobile phone images have become a kind of visual speech – an immediate, intimate form of communication that replaces writing’. Contemporary users of digital platforms and media thus seem to be confirming Flusser’s tongue-in-cheek assessment that ‘Images ... are not so repulsive as massive rows of fat books’."

          text: "It is worth probing further why Flusser would resort to the aforementioned idea of the image apocalypse when looking through the images into the future. One may be tempted to equate his conceptualisation with the dismissal of the increasing photographic output in terms of an image deluge. This latter metaphor was poignantly encapsulated by Erik Kessels – a Dutch photographer, curator, advertiser and designer who can be described as the Jeff Koons of the photography world – in his installation 24 HRS in Photos. In November 2011 Kessels filled an Amsterdam art gallery with prints of images that had been uploaded to Flickr over a 24-hour period. The visitors were presented with heaps of what looked like debris, spilling everywhere. The fact that this spillage had been carefully controlled by a number of wooden frames into which it had been placed to create this illusion of a flow not only tells us something about the artist’s visual cant but also points to our wider desire for beautiful ruins, with aestheticisation of the apocalypse often having an anaesthetic function. And thus the project could easily be read as an indictment of photography today, with its pointless content, visual sameness and vapid content. Yet, following Elisabeth Kessler, it is also possible to read the installation as revealing the Flusserian apparatus in action, demonstrating human and machinic forces at work in the production of (the picture of) the world, while bringing forth a shared ‘thingness’ of our media ecologies. ‘A person chose when and how to take each picture, but broader influences – human and nonhuman – shape the way we represent, see, and live in the world’. The image apocalypse does not therefore have to mean humans perishing in the debris of the world, but rather the expiration of the Anthropocene hubris enacted by the drowning of its core subject. Well versed in the canonical texts of Western culture, including its religious writings, Flusser was no doubt aware that the apocalypse was not just a catastrophe and that its occurrence, come what may, also carried a redemptive potential."

          text: "Before we move on to its redemptive aspects, we need to recognise that there are different levels of ‘no future’ announced in Flusser’s work, with entropy, or heat death – an occurrence resulting from the dissipation of information as explained by the second law of thermodynamics – constituting our world’s ‘event horizon’. Finalist realisations have organised the worldview of many modern philosophers – from the singular human’s horizon of death as encountered in the writing of Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre through to the death of the sun as the star that nourishes our planet in the writings of Jean-François Lyotard. In a similar vein, Flusser’s planetary perspective is meant to allow us to come to terms with the absurdity of the world, with its ultimate lack of meaning. But this is a form of pragmatic absurdism, one devoid of wallowing in tragedy and loss. Flusser accepts from the word go that the fate of the universe is subject to chance, that the end-game of this chance is entropy and that any occurrences, be they ‘galactic spirals, living cells, or human brains’, are the result of improbable coincidences, ‘erroneous’ exceptions ‘to the general rule of increasing entropy’. Yet he quickly moves beyond that realisation to introduce a differentiation between the cosmic programme of the universe, which we can’t do very much about, and the human-designed programme of the apparatus, which remains subject to human control – or which at least entails the possibility of the human wresting away some degree of control, be it through insurgence or chance. ‘Envisioners are people who try to turn an automatic apparatus against its own condition of being automatic’. Any act of resistance can therefore only come from within and via the apparatus. Flusser may be no photographer but he himself takes on the role of an enframer and an informer – someone who can rearrange particles, or pixels, to create a new ‘mosaic’, provide new information and offer a new vision. Creativity as an act of working against the machine, not in a Luddite manner that rejects it tout court but rather in defiance of its programme, is a task he implores us all to adopt, while there is still time."

          text: "Flusser is thus interested in photography as a mode of thinking and seeing to come, or one that has already partly come. His assessment that ‘We live in an illusory world of technical images, and we increasingly experience, recognize, evaluate, and act as a function of these images’ applies even more aptly to the era of social media and wide image sharing. Photography thus serves for Flusser as a model for understanding the functioning of the apparatus – and for taking the apparatus to task. It also becomes a laboratory for seeing otherwise, for reprogramming our vision of the world by creating better, i.e., more informed, pictures of it, with technical images being ‘phantoms that can give the world, and us, meaning’. It is in this sense that photography for Flusser has an existential significance. While he recognises that entropic decay is already part of our everyday experience, expressing itself ‘in the receivers’ zeal for the sensational – there have always to be new images because all images have long since begun to get boring’, he also observes, perhaps jokingly to some extent, that no apocalyptic catastrophe of nuclear or similar finalist kind is needed as ‘technical images are themselves the end’. Images themselves are thus ‘apocalyptic’ because they replace the linearity of writing, and thus of history, with the cybernetic feedback loop of the image flow – which becomes a magic circle of eternal return.\n\nIn the poignant assessment of the Instagram culture writer Dayna Tortorici has provided the following visceral account of what that loop actually looks like in the age of social media."

          text: "Tortorici describes the experience of the human viewer of images (in this case, herself) being faced with an Instagram flow in terms of entering into a loop of exchanges not only with other human photographers but also with the platform’s algorithms. The loops of her brain activity generated by the intensifying visual stimuli coming from the pictures of friends, strangers, objects and places eventually lead to affective overdrive. This state of high agitation is being sustained by the repetitive behaviour of sliding and tapping, with the viewer’s eyes and fingers enacting their own loopy dance in search of yet another dopamine hit. Flusser points out that the ‘general consensus between images and people’ – as evidenced in the popularity scores achieved by various images – inscribes itself in the repetitive cycle: nature – culture – waste – nature. We may update it as ‘Flower – like – skip – the great outdoors. Woman I vaguely know – heart – unheart – God I hate her. Food – avo on toast – skip – #sohungry’. But there is an escape from, or at least opening within, that world of ‘meaninglessness’ and ‘historical amnesia’ on its way to heat death.The redemptive aspect of Flusser’s apocalypse lies in the redefinition of the human as part of the ‘composting’ loop. This entails dissolving the myth of the human ‘I’ as ‘a core that must be preserved and developed’."

          text: "Repositioned as ‘an abstract hook on which to hang concrete circumstances, the “I” reveals itself to be nothing’. The Flusserian apocalypse thus involves destroying the Judeo-Christian image of the human as a being, made, albeit imperfectly, in the image of God and equipped with some core qualities, qualities whose nature has to be both veiled and revered. For Flusser, the “I” only emerges in a dialogue. Building on the philosophy of Martin Buber while also giving it a cybernetic twist in his image of a society as a ‘dialogical cerebral web’, Flusser claims that the ‘“I” is the one to whom someone says “you” ’. The communication model of subjectivity is not just linked to acts of speech; as previously stated, for Flusser the medium really becomes the message – and the messenger. Our consciousness is thus seen as being shaped by the media we make and use, and which also make and use us. This model of (say, Instagram- driven) subjectivity dispenses with universal humanist signal points such as choice, decision and free will. Flusser does nevertheless offer an opening within this cybernetic-naturalistic theorisation of the human. A being produced, literally, from media res, one whose brain ‘appeared as an accident in the natural game of chance’, the human has the possibility of mobilising this aleatory game as a strategy. S/he can do this because the brain has an inbuilt tendency to turn against chance, defy accident and reject entropy. However, for the human’s negentropic tendency to be actualised certain conditions need to be created. Flusser’s whole oeuvre, one might argue, is premised on identifying those conditions."

          text: "**Photography and Future-Making**\n\nAs well as being authors of their own destruction, human beings – who have inaugurated and then labelled a geological epoch in their name – are also a guarantee of our planet’s survival. Humans thus can be said to have an inbuilt counterapocalyptic tendency. Even if this survival is just a delay, humans are an opportunity for the world, as well as functioning as its existential threat. The answer about the future – of images, writing, the world, or anything else – is therefore also a matter of temporal scale. Images themselves, and, in particular, technical images as produced and exchanged via platforms such as Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat, can serve as delaying tactics in this process of information dissipation, even if the majority of them do nothing of the kind. As an Instagram user Flusser would have no doubt been bemused by the banality, sameness and predictability of the output. Yet his existential-level conclusion, ‘I play with images ... to coexist’, would surely serve as an encouragement not to sign off too quickly – from social media, from sociality and from the world as we know it.\n\nThe answer to the question ‘Does photography have a future?’ thus depends on who is posing it and what time scale they operate on. If it’s a curator or a gallery owner interested in securing investment on their Henri Cartier-Bresson or Ansel Adams, they probably have a few good years left. If it’s a photojournalist or a professional wedding photographer, the writing is on the wall, at least as far as high income is concerned – unless they can undergo a cross-media shift to become a personal TV channel. For those who are too busy posting on Instagram or editing their selfies to be even interested in posing it, because most of the things they know come from living in the constant image flow, some other questions maybe more pertinent than the one about the state of the photographic medium, its supporting institutions and its industry: When looking at, sharing and con- tributing to the media flow, what kind of future do you see, for yourself and the world? What kind of existence can you carve out and enframe from the media and image flow?"

          text: "In the Judeo-Christian culture, the world was seen as ‘an image made in God’s likeness’. It was a representational model of the world, whereby humans were seen as part of God’s creation. In the universe of the image apparatus, the world is an image without a divine origin. What is more, it has become increasingly impossible to distinguish between a representation and a model. We could go so far as to argue that now all images have become what filmmaker Harun Farocki has termed ‘operational images’, carrying the potential of an execution of a function. According to Flusser, ‘From now on, we are the ones who project meaning on the world. And technical images are such projections’. Reprogramming the apparatus thus also means taking responsibility for our role in the co-creation of images, be it with technical devices or our cortico-corporeal apparatus, in full knowledge that we are neither sole authors nor sole recipients of the incessant media and image flow – although we may be the only ones for whom shaping this flow into a set of meanings becomes an ethico-political task, rather than just a pre-programmed function to be executed. The fact that the majority of people function as if that was not the case, running the programmes of the apparatus in and with their lives, cameras, phones and other media, only makes this task more urgent."

          text: "Flusser himself already pronounced in 1985, several decades before the wide adoption of photogrammetry, CGI and AI-driven image making, that ‘photography is about to become redundant’. With this, he was referring to the increased generation of synthetic images, as a result of which it had become impossible to ‘distinguish between depictions and models’. Yet, even if the medium and the practice of photography as we know them may indeed become obsolete, the function of photography will no doubt survive for a long time yet – although its execution, in the fully informational guise, will perhaps only be executed by the very few. Like writing, which is ‘a mesh of accident and necessity’ yet which is nevertheless ‘experienced’ by us code-driven and code-making humans ‘as a free gesture’, photography will present us with new opportunities, beyond trying to seek meaning and order in the world, be it via religion or everyday semiosis. To approach the medium of photography through the ‘existential register’ outlined by Lagerkvist is to shift photography’s future role from memory-making to future-making, while repositioning the photographer as the very maker (or, to use Flusser’s term, ‘envisioner’) of those futures. The future photographer’s gesture of pointing at the world can be expected to generate a whole new ‘revolutionary attitude’ , one which will involve projecting meaning onto the world. Technical images, be it in their photographic or post-photographic guises, are capable of functioning as such projections. Through this photography has the potential to ‘give absurdity a meaning’ – not in a semiotic sense, but rather through reframing the photographic act and gesture as meaningful in themselves – and thus serve as a life force, a generator of experiences transmitted as images. Transcending its representative function as the ‘pencil of nature’ or ‘the mirror of life’, photography can instead become the future, for better or for worse."

                        AArchitecture is the student-run magazine of the Architectural Association and welcomes
                        contributions from all professions and perspectives.<br/><br/>
                        <b>Format of Contributions:</b><br/>
                        As we are transitioning from a print magazine into an online publication, we will be increasing
                        the range of contribution media beyond writing, to include photography, films, and artwork
                        amongst others.<br/><br/>
                        At the end of the editorial cycle an anthology will be published, bringing together online
                        contributions to AArchitecture in physical form.

            The Warm War is an intermediary space. It’s not quite the Cold War: the open hostility, espionage
            and nuclear dread that made up the power struggle between Federalism and Communism. Neither is it a
            ‘hot’ war: a carving of a boundary through total violence.
            The Warm War is a murkier conflict.
            <br /><br />
            It is being fought primarily with technocratic instruments, where operatives traverse planetary
            infrastructures with covert military operations, insidious new modes of combat, deceptive targeting,
            and backroom policy transformation. It is data warfare; never virtual, always material. Information
            and misinformation flow through social media and mobile feeds. For policy makers, military and
            corporate strategists, these noise machines become a battleground. This shifting axis of conflict
            continuously thickens and thins boundaries of negotiation.<br />
            One message pierces through the noise. Findings from the IPCC’s 6th Climate Report in 2021 show that
            we are at a tipping point for action. Multiple and complex changes are already underway in every
            part of our planet, and we can ‘expect global temperature to reach or exceed 1.5°C of warming over
            the next 20 years’. The headline is trotted out so often that we forget the rupture that is implied.
            <br/><br/>
            Welcome to the Warm War, a conflict of spatial re-organisation in which animals, vegetation and
            minerals are irreducibly entangled. In this complex knot of material and knowledge networks,
            tethered and untethered, separated and yet enmeshed, we must move past the semiotic noise operations
            reducing action to a series of signs; fake targets, unthinking clichés, memes, hot air. <br/><br/>
            AArchitecture will build an incomplete mosaic of the Warm War, within which its complexity can
            partially unravel and frame forms of action. <br/>

            Photographer Bas Princen has published a new book looking at the visual and personal backstory to one
            particular photograph, seen above, “Ringroad (Houston),” from 2005. Called The Construction of an Image, the
            book is also the final publication from Bedford Press.
            It is, the book’s editor, Vanessa Norwood, writes, “an arresting image: an ordinary American office block
            transformed by Princen’s lens into a glowing golden cube cut by the horizon, acting as both mirror and
            container; the reflected landscape of trees confined within its gridded exterior.”
            As part of his work process, Princen assembles small research notebooks of images he is thinking of or
            influenced by during the production of certain images; The Construction of an Image includes those along
            with other examples of Princen’s work created at the same time. As such, it offers a sustained glimpse of
            how Princen operates, how visual concepts are formed, and how analogies are identified and tracked from one
            building or landscape to another.
            In the case of “Ringroad (Houston),” these precedent images range from engravings by Albrecht Dürer—fitting
            the world into a perspectival grid—to photographs taken inside geodesic domes, and from corporate lobbies to
            archaeological earthworks. These represent moments or sites where solitary structures, all-encompassing
            geometric frames or grids, and uneasy distinctions between foreground and background predominate.
            I’m proud to have a short essay featured in the book, alongside texts by editor Vanessa Norwood, architect
            Kersten Geers, curator Moritz Küng, and a summary by Princen himself.
            Geers, in particular, swings for the fences with his assessment of the photo, writing, “Bas Princen’s
            photograph Ringroad (Houston) encapsulates, through its simple presence and curious ambiguity, almost
            everything I feel we can ever say about architecture,” continuing over the rest of his essay to explain how
            the photo went on to influence Geers’s own architectural design work.
            My own look at the image is in the context of Princen’s output, from Los Angeles to Dubai, focusing on his
            images in which “there is often an extraordinary, building-size geometric shape in the center of the frame,
            yet it is not always clear if it can be described as architecture. (…) Rather, these abstract
            objects—sometimes mirrored, sometimes with no visible points of entry—function more like undeclared
            monuments with no clear subject of commemoration. They are, in a sense, both unexplained and inexplicable.”
            If you’re curious to see a slightly different sort of approach, Princen’s photos are also—as of yesterday—on
            display at the Met Breuer museum in New York City.
            In a show called Breuer Revisited, photographers Luisa Lambri and Princen both offer their own distinctive
            visual analyses of four buildings designed by Marcel Breuer.
            “Evoking minimalism and abstraction,” the museum explains, “Lambri creates images that examine the dialogue
            between interior and exterior, and the interaction between surface and light. Princen investigates and
            reframes urban and rural spaces through documenting the concept of post-occupancy, or the evolution of a
            building and its enduring relevance.”
            The show is open until May 21, 2017; The Construction of an Image is available through the Architectural
            Association.
            Photographer Bas Princen has a fantastic new exhibition, called “Refuge,” up at Storefront for Art and
            Architecture. Tonight, Tuesday, May 11, Princen will be at the gallery for a public event and opening, and
            it’s well worth checking out.
            Storefront describes the show as a “photographic fiction”:
            Although it is the result of extensive travels and research in five cities of the Middle East and
            Turkey—Istanbul, Beirut, Amman, Cairo and Dubai—it could just as easily pass as the pictorial record of a
            dérive through a single, imaginary city: a city without a center, populated by extraordinary and at times
            implausible architectural artefacts; an urban laboratory whose physical traits are defined by migratory
            flows, spatial transformation and geopolitical flux on a continental scale.
            As part of a poster published in tandem with the exhibition, former Storefront director Joseph Grima
            interviewed Princen about his work, starting off with an inquiry into how Princen’s own background in
            architectural studies might have affected his photographic approach to the built and natural environments
            (the interview is also available at Domus).

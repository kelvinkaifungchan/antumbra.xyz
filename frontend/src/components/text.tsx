            The techno-social hypothesis concerns the idea that, over the last three decades or so, the technological
            and the social have become thoroughly enmeshed with each other. It also poses the question of how this new
            inseparability should be understood. The techno-social hypothesis is not about how, as Bernard Stiegler
            claimed, social media have bypassed “the traditional networks of proximity that have defined the social
            since time immemorial.”
            Neither is it about how technology has subsumed and colonized social life, and how this process might be
            reversed to gain access to a more authentic, embodied sociality. It is rather about the fundamental role
            played by “the social” in the modern age, and how contemporary digital and computational networks as
            technical beings do not just generate, as Gilbert Simondon suggested, a natural and technical milieu, but
            also a directly (techno-)social one.<br /><br />
            The techno-social hypothesis is thus premised on the idea that the
            social never possessed an intrinsic or preexisting reality, but rather what, with Michel Foucault, we might
            call a historical, that is a “transactional” one. Like sexuality, madness, or civil society, the social is
            real, although it has not always existed. It, too, was born “from the interplay of relations of power and
            everything which constantly eludes them at the interface … of governors and governed.”
            As a result of this history, the social assumed its three fundamental properties: a form of abstraction, the
            territory of government, and a conflictual political domain.

            The social thus existed inasmuch as it was a fundamental part of modern Western European epistemologies and
            eventually also as part of its governmentalities. As a form of abstraction, it grounded the truth claims of
            the social sciences, which posited that it was possible to scientifically study human societies inasmuch as
            they presented quantitative and qualitative determinations. As part of what Denise Ferreira da Silva has
            called the power of the nomos, the social entailed a distinction between transparency and affectability,
            between the position of observers and observed. This epistemological function of the social (that is, its
            accounting for human social life as a distinct, measurable, and observable sphere of reality, endowed with
            its own patterns and regularities) was also indispensable to the other role that the social played. As
            Nikolas Rose put it, from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, the social constituted the “territory
            of government,” that is, a “novel plane of territorialization [which] existed within, across, in tension
            with other spatializations (such as blood and territory; race and religion; town, region and nation).” At
            the same time, the social also had a third inflection, one that Raymond Williams defined as its “emphatic”
            one: one that explicitly opposed individual and especially individualist theories of societies. This is the
            social which, as Wendy Brown has put it, constitutes the foremost language and political domain “where
            subjections, abjections, and exclusions are lived, identified, protested and potentially
            rectified.”<br /><br />
            Inasmuch as it constituted a nexus of power/knowledge/subjectivation which functioned within both liberal
            and socialist governmentalities, the social was said to have come to its end in the late 1970s when a new
            political rationality—neoliberalism—displaced it with the more narrow notion of “community.” For postmodern
            philosophers such as Jean Baudrillard, the end of the social coincided with the rise of media, information,
            and capital coming together through the figure of the network. The circulatory logic of the Los Angeles
            highway system was Baudrillard’s favorite image for the end of the social in a space defined by circulation.
